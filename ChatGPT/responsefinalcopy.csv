However, because ChatGPT is a free and powerful tool, cheating has become much easier. Thus, it begs the question - why do students cheat, generally speaking?","Looking at the possible reasons in the previous question, we now consider why students would have such feelings that would make them want to cheat. We consider looking at the bigger picture, the possible role our education system plays (note: we are generalizing the education system since ones such as Denmark’s is considered to be excellent by popular belief).
Perhaps AI has surpassed us in order to show us that we have to re-evaluate the format of our assigned work and standardized testing, and shift towards non-traditional methods.
Is the proficiency of ChatGPT causing the rise in cheating, or is the bigger problem at hand the education system?","How should academic institutions regulate the students' use of ChatGPT?
